# MultiWarpTool
Multi Theft Auto mapping tool.

Multi-Warp-Tool

Objective:
My friend "eXecuteR" and I "-ffs-AbodyRulez" decided to create a definite warping tool, by definite we mean that the warps will get stored in a database, unlike other warping tools that store their warps in volatile variables.

How Could It Be Useful:
As mappers, We've always wanted a warping tool that could save few extra warps in maps, saving a good amount of time in mapping instead of driving all the way through until reaching a certain part, plus, we got sick of those warping tools that keep having bugs and loosing warps. Due to that, we decided to start a new script from scratch and added a few extra features.

Features:

Saving multiple warps serial based
Saving a primary warp usual /save to save a warp
Loading primary warps
Loading others warps
Deleting warps you can only delete your saved warps, Admin access needed to delete others'
Deleting all warps Admin access needed
